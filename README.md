# Global_Sales_data_analysis

Project Overview:

I searched for and chose an appropriate dataset on Kaggle that would meet a typical superstore demand on a global scale in my pursuit of knowledge and awareness of which items, geographies, categories, and consumer segments a company should target or avoid. Companies are looking for strategies to maximize earnings in light of the marketâ€™s fierce competition and expanding demands.

Data Cleaning:
In order to clean the data, duplicates must be eliminated and null or missing values must be handled. I began by putting the data into a dataframe from a csv file using the Python pandas library, then I imported the necessary libraries and prepared the data for future analysis.

I went on to analyze the data by asking some questions relevant to the insights to be gotten from the data. The questions asked are as follows.

What was the category sales by region? That is, how did each category perform in terms of sales in each region?

What was the profit by each category?

What was the categories sales in each month? That is, how did each category perform in terms of sales in each month?

How many customers does the business have? thus, what is the customer retention rate per year?

What amount of profit was made in each region?

The answers to the aforementioned questions are visualised on the analysis dashboard.

What was the total sales per year?

What was the total profit per year?

Without any further ado, the data was visualized using Microsoft excel showing the answers to the aforementioned questions. The dashboard showing the visualization of the data is shown as follows.
